# Contributing

Oh please, yes! There are several things your can contribute:

* Ideas
* Code
* Support for further devices
* Translations
* Confirmations of the watchface working on devices

All kinds of contributions are managed through GitHub. Here’s how!

## Ideas

Simply [create a new issue](https://github.com/le-cds/connectiq-faceymcwatchface/issues) and make a heartfelt case about what you’d like to get done, and perhaps why. Links to money are appreciated, but cute pictures of cats will do fine.

## Code

Clone the repository and hack away. Finish off with a pull request against the main repository’s master branch and wait for me to complain. Seriously, I might request changes. Politely. Be prepared.

If you’re working on an existing issue, it would be great if you could comment on it so I know what’s going on.

## Support for Further Devices

We currently support a whole bunch of devices, but we might support more as long as they support Connect IQ 3. Feel free to create [a layout](https://github.com/le-cds/connectiq-faceymcwatchface/blob/master/resources/layouts/layout.xml) for a new device and either [create a new issue](https://github.com/le-cds/connectiq-faceymcwatchface/issues) with the new file attached, or provide a pull request.

## Translations

We currently don’t support as many languages as the world offers, which is mainly due to my spectacularly limited knowledge of said languages. If you happen to be able to decipher English and translate it to another language, feel free to provide a version of the following files:

* `resources/strings/strings.xml`
* `sources/indicators.json`
* `sources/meters.json`

Either [create a new issue](https://github.com/le-cds/connectiq-faceymcwatchface/issues) with the new files attached, or better yet: provide a pull request.

## Confirmations of the Watchface Working on Devices

If you can confirm my suspicions of the watchface actually working on a physical device you happen to have, [create a new issue](https://github.com/le-cds/connectiq-faceymcwatchface/issues) to tell me about it and I’ll update the readme accordingly.
