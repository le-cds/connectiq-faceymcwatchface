A watchface geared towards productivity features and a clean interface.

Highlights are:

* It shows the time, and does a pretty good job, too!
* Time of next appointment. This requires an accompanying Android app to be installed on an Android phone. iPhones are not yet supported - sorry.
* On-device configuration on compatible watches.
* Colour themes.

Facey McWatchface supports displaying a wide array of information, and what show up where can be configured:

* Active Alarms
* Active minutes
* Altitude
* Battery Charge
* Bluetooth state
* Calories (kCal)
* Distance travelled
* Do not Disturb
* Floors climbed
* Floors descended
* Heart rate
* Move bar
* Next appointment
* Steps stepped
* Sync interval
* Unread notifications

Facey McWatchface does not collect any kinds of data. It requires the following permissions:

* Run in the background. If appointments are shown, the watchface regularly checks for messages sent by the accompanying Android app in the background. The only data transmitted are timestamps of upcoming appointments.
* Send/receive information to/from the internet. Required to receive information from the accompanying Android app in the first place. No information are sent to or received from the internet.
