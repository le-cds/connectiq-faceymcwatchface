# Facey McWatchface

A watchface for Garmin smartwatches with a focus on communication instead of fitness. Looks something like this:

## Main Feature: Time of Upcoming Appointment

The watchface is able to show the time of the upcoming appointment. Only appointments in the upcoming 24 hours (minus 5 minutes) are displayed. The whole thing only works if a companion app, [Calendar IQ Connector](https://github.com/le-cds/android-calendariq), is installed on an Android mobile the watch is connected to. That app will send information on upcoming appointments to the watch in regular intervals.
